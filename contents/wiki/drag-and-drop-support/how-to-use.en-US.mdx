## Launch

Drag and Drop Support uses `--python` arguments, then cannot be used with normal launch.
Therfore, launch Blender from a dedicated launcher.

Unzip the downloaded ZIP archive and launch it via the enclosed `blender-launcher-ui.exe`.  
Once launched, specify the path to `blender.exe` and press the bottom button.

## Start Listener

To import files via Drag-and-Drop, you need to enable the extension.  
Open the `Drag and Drop Support` tab from the sidebar of Layout View, Modeling View, and other views in Blender.  
After opening it, you will see a button called `Start Listener`, click on the button.

After clicking the button, if you see `Stop Listener`, it has been started the listener, and you can then drop the file into the 3D View, and etc.  
A few seconds after the file has been dropped, the file will be loaded into `(0, 0, 0)`.
